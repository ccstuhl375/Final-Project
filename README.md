## Examination of Physical and Chemical Properties of Volcanic Sites to Used to Determine Risk

OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024  

*For this final project I was excited to explore how the chemical properties and physical behaviors of volcanic features relates to risk. After reading several papers that found that the explosivity or lack there of in a volcano was tied at least partially to the chemical composition of its lava, I decided to compare the chemical profiles of several different sites to the general severity of an eruption as observed in seismic data, and human observation (VEI).I found that while the physical behaviors of a volcanic site are often related to each other, one site is always unique and cannot be used to asses the risk of another.However there are several errors in my method that may have contributed to this outcome that I will discuss in my report.*
